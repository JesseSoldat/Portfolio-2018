      "I was born and raised in Iowa. I completed a two-year degree in LAN Management at Kirkwood Community College. During this time, a trip starting in Cancun, Mexico and then sidetracking to Belize and Guatemala with a friend, changed my life forever. This experience sparked a larger desire to see the world. I went on more trips including a multi-country excursion from Mexico all the way to Panama and Peru. I also took a trip to Hawaii, which motivated me to move there and continue my education."

      "Before graduating and moving to Hawaii I began studying Japanese. I decided to pursue a degree in Asian Studies in a place like Oahu because of the large prevalence of Japanese culture. During the beginning of my studies I was awarded the Honda Scholarship to study in Osaka, Japan for a year. The time in Japan was by far the most rewarding thing in my life because I was able to fully immerse myself in Japanese language and culture. Japanese culture really clicked with me and I soaked up the zen nature of the society. Upon completing my study abroad, I returned to Hawaii to finish my degree. At that time, an old friend invited me to teach a technology course at a school that he worked at in Bangkok, Thailand."

      "I moved to Thailand and all in all spent about 6 years teaching English to students ranging from kindergarten to middle school. Being involved in the educational system proved to be very rewarding for me. During this time I consistently tried to enrich myself with studying the Thai language and being immersed in the international melting pot known as Bangkok. I really enjoyed living in Thailand but I was far from family and I didn’t see a lot of opportunity to build a career. I decided to return to the U.S. and join my family who had migrated to Atlanta."

      "I immediately fell in love with Atlanta’s lush green trees coupled with its creative energy and thriving technological scene. While I knew Atlanta was the perfect fit for me, I was still struggling to find the right career path. Drawing on my previous experience in LAN, I started to study for a Cisco Certification until I heard about the Iron Yard. I spent a little over a month prepping for this intensive course which proved to be the most challenging thing I have ever done. The course pushed me to my limit, and I came out stronger because it. During this time I have developed a love for JavaScript and its many related technologies. Being able to build and create things is a truly self-gratifying experience. Now that I have found my passion, I am dedicated to building a long and successful career where ever I now call home."
