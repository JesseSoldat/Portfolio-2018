      "Five Words is an app for finding friends based on your most important words.  By limiting the user to just five words we try to push the user to choose their words with great thought and consideration.  What if five words are not enough?  No problem Five Words also offer category searches such as travel, books, food where users can pick five words for each category section and perform more refined searches."

No worries.  Start with finding stories near your locale.  Want to branch out?  Then just increase the distance of your search as you explore the world one story at a time."
